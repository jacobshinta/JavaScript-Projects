### Pizza Menu

Simple menu used to order pizza with a variety of toppings. It gathers the input information and calculates the price based on the user's selections.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic representation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played by selecting squares and trying to line up 3 "X's" in a row, while preventing the computer from getting 3 "O's" lined up.

### Calculator

A basic calculator capable of adding, multiplying, subtracting, and dividing.
